## 🌟 Premium Features

### 🌌 The Navigator (Main Interface)
- **Automatic Discovery**: Instantly scans and identifies Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Java, Scala, PHP, and Ruby projects.
- **Deep Detail View**: Press `Enter` to reveal project manifests, detected frameworks, and available scripts.
- **Custom Actions**: Save persistent, project-specific commands with `Shift+C` (e.g., `deploy|npm run deploy --prod`).
- **Live Output Panel**: Stream real-time logs from active processes with dedicated scrolling (`Shift+↑/↓`).

### 🛰️ Orbit Task Manager (`Shift+T`)
- **Background Orchestration**: Keep tasks running while you navigate the rest of your workspace.
- **Process Management**: Monitor status (Running, Finished, Failed, Killed) and forcefully terminate processes with `Shift+K`.
- **Task Identity**: Rename tasks on the fly with `Shift+R` to keep your workspace organized.
- **Cross-Platform Safety**: Automatically handles process signaling for both Unix (SIGKILL) and Windows (taskkill) to ensure clean exits.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Customization

Project Compass is designed to be personalized. All settings and custom commands are stored in a local JSON file.

- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.project-compass/config.json`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<YourUser>\.project-compass\config.json`

### 🛠️ Adding Custom Commands
You can add your own project-specific commands directly within the app by pressing **Shift+C** in the Detail View. Use the format `Label|Command` (e.g., `Deploy|npm run deploy`).

### 📁 Manual Config Structure
If you prefer manual editing, the `config.json` follows this structure:

```json
{
  "showArtBoard": true,
  "showHelpCards": false,
  "showStructureGuide": false,
  "customCommands": {
    "/path/to/your/project": [
      {
        "label": "Build Production",
        "command": ["npm", "run", "build", "--prod"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `showArtBoard/HelpCards/Structure`: Persistence for your UI visibility preferences.
- `customCommands`: A map of absolute project paths to arrays of command objects.

## 🚀 Vision
Project Compass is designed to be the "Last Terminal Tool" you ever need to open. It bridges the gap between raw CLI commands and full IDEs, giving you a professional, reactive cockpit for all your development work.
